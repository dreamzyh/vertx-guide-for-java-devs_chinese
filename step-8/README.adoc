= 使用RxJava进行响应式编程

TIP: 相应的源代码位于指南存储库的 `step-8` 文件夹中。

到目前为止，我们已经使用基于回调的API探索了Vert.x堆栈的各个领域。 它只是能运行，并且这种编程模型在很多编程语言的开发人员中都是众所周知的。 然而，它可能会变得有点乏味，特别是当你结合几个事件源或处理复杂的数据流时。

这正是RxJava发挥的作用，Vert.x可以无缝集成它。

== 启用RxJava API

除了基于回调的API之外，Vert.x模块还提供了 _"Rxified"_ API。 要启用它，首先将 `vertx-rx-java` 模块添加到Maven POM文件中：

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=vertx-rx-java]
----

Verticles then have to be modified so that they extend `io.vertx.rxjava.core.AbstractVerticle` instead of `io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle`.
How is this different? The former class extends the latter and exposes a `io.vertx.rxjava.core.Vertx` field.

`io.vertx.rxjava.core.Vertx` defines extra `rxSomething(...)` methods that are equivalent to their callback-based counterparts.

Let's take a look at the `MainVerticle` to get a better idea of how it works in practice:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=rx-deploy-verticle]
----

The `rxDeploy` method does not take a `Handler<AsyncResult<String>>` as final parameter.
Instead, it returns a `Single<String>`.

Besides, the operation does not start when the method is called.
It starts when you subscribe to the `Single`.
When the operation completes, it emits the deployment `id` or signals the cause of the problem with a `Throwable`.

== Deploying verticles in order

To finalize the `MainVerticle` refactoring, we must make sure the deployment operations get triggered and happen in order:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=rx-sequential-composition]
----
<1> The `flatMap` operator applies the function to the result of `dbVerticleDeployment`. Here it schedules the deployment of the `HttpServerVerticle`.
<2> Operations start when subscribing. On success or on error, the `MainVerticle` start future is either completed or failed.

== Partially _"Rxifying"_ `HttpServerVerticle`

If you follow the guide in sequence, editing the code as you go, your `HttpServerVerticle` class is still using the
callback-based API. Before you can use the RxJava API to execute asynchronous operations _naturally_, i.e.
*_concurrently_*, you need to refactor `HttpServerVerticle`.

=== Import RxJava versions of Vert.x classes

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=rx-imports]
----
<1> Our `backupHandler()` method still uses `HttpResponse` class, so it must be imported. It turns out that the RxJava
version of `HttpResponse` provided by Vert.x can serve as a drop-in replacement in this specific case.
The _"Rxified"_ code in `step-8` folder of the guide repository does not import this class as the
response type is inferred by the lambda expression.

=== Use delegate on a _"Rxified"_ `vertx` instance

To call a method expecting a `io.vertx.core.Vertx` instance when you have a `io.vertx.rxjava.core.Vertx` one, call
the `getDelegate()` method. Verticle's `start()` method needs to be adjusted when creating an instance of
`WikiDatabaseService`:

include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=rx-vertx-delegate]
----

== Executing authorization queries concurrently

In the previous example, we saw how to use RxJava operators and the Rxified Vert.x API to execute asynchronous operations in order.
But sometimes this guarantee is not required, or you simply want them to run concurrently for performance reasons.

The JWT token generation process in the `HttpServerVerticle` is a good example of such a situation.
To create a token, we need all authorization query results to complete, but queries are independent from each other:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=rx-concurrent-composition]
----
<1> Three `Single` objects are created, representing the different authorization queries.
<2> When the three operations complete successfully, the `zip` operator callback is invoked with the results.

== Working with database connections

To acquire a database connection from the pool, all you have to do is calling `rxGetConnection` on the `JDBCClient`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
Single<SQLConnection> connection = dbClient.rxGetConnection();
----

The method returns a `Single<Connection>` which you can easily transform with `flatMap` to execute SQL queries:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/database/WikiDatabaseServiceImpl.java[tags=rx-execute-query-with-params]
----

But how can we release the connection if the `SQLConnection` reference is no longer reachable?
A simple and convenient way to do this is to invoke `close` when the `Single<SQLConnection>` is unsubscribed:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/database/WikiDatabaseServiceImpl.java[tags=rx-get-connection]
----
<1> After the connection is acquired we wrap it into a `Single`
<2> The `Single` is modified to invoke `close` when unsubscribed

Now we shall use `getConnection` anytime we need to execute SQL queries in our database verticle.

== Bridging the gap between callbacks and RxJava

At times, you may have to mix your RxJava code with a callback-based API.
For example, service proxy interfaces can only be defined with callbacks, but the implementation uses the Vert.x Rxified API.

In this case, the `io.vertx.rx.java.RxHelper` class can adapt a `Handler<AsyncResult<T>>` to an RxJava `Subscriber<T>`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/database/WikiDatabaseServiceImpl.java[tags=rxhelper-to-subscriber]
----
<1> `fetchAllPagesData` is an asynchronous service proxy operation, defined with a `Handler<AsyncResult<List<JsonObject>>>` callback.
<2> The `toSubscriber` method adapts the `resultHandler` to a `Subscriber<List<JsonObject>>`, so that the handler is invoked when the list of rows is emitted.

== Data flows

RxJava is not only great at combining different sources of events, it is also very helpful with data flows.
Unlike a Vert.x or JDK future, an `Observable` emits a stream of events, not just a single one.
And it comes with an extensive set of data manipulation operators.

We can use a few of them to refactor the `fetchAllPages` database verticle method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/database/WikiDatabaseServiceImpl.java[tags=rx-data-flow]
----
<1> With `flatMapObservable` we will create an `Observable` from the item emitted by the `Single<Result>`.
<2> `from` converts the database `results` iterable into an `Observable` emitting the database row items.
<3> Since we only need the page name we can `map` each `JsonObject` row to the first column.
<4> The client expects the data to be `sorted` in alphabetical order.
<5> The event bus service reply consists in a single `JsonArray`. `collect` creates a new one with `JsonArray::new` and later adds items as they are emitted with `JsonArray::add`.
