= 用Vert.x编写的最小可使用的wiki

TIP: 相应的源代码位于指南存储库的 `step-1` 文件夹中。

我们将从第一次迭代开始，最简单的代码可能是用Vert.x编写一个wiki。 虽然接下来的迭代将会在代码库中引入更多的功能以及正确的测试，但是我们将会看到，使用Vert.x进行快速原型设计既是一个简单而又实际的选择。

在这个阶段，wiki将使用HTML页面的服务器端呈现和通过JDBC进行数据持久性。 为此，我们将使用以下库。

1. http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/[Vert.x web]作为Vert.x核心库支持创建HTTP服务器，但不提供简洁的API来处理路由，处理请求的有效载荷等。
2. http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-jdbc-client/java/[Vert.x JDBC 客户端]通过JDBC提供异步API。
3. http://freemarker.org/[Apache FreeMarker]渲染服务器端页面，因为它是一个简单的模板引擎。
4. https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark[Txtmark]将Markdown文本呈现为HTML，允许在Markdown中编辑wiki页面。

== 引导一个Maven项目

本指南选择使用 https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven]作为构建工具，主要是因为它与主要的集成开发环境很好地结合在一起。 您可以同样使用另一个构建工具，如 https://gradle.org/[Gradle]。

Vert.x社区提供了可以克隆的来自https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-maven-starter的模板项目结构。 由于您也可能想要使用（Git）版本控制，最快的方法是克隆存储库，删除其 `.git/` 文件夹，然后创建一个新的Git存储库：

    git clone https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-maven-starter.git vertx-wiki
    cd vertx-wiki
    rm -rf .git
    git init

该项目提供了一个简单的verticle以及单元测试。 您可以安全地删除 `src/` 下的所有 `.java` 文件来破解wiki，但在这之前，您可以测试项目是否成功建立并运行：

    mvn package exec:java

你会注意到Maven项目的 `pom.xml` 有两个有趣的事情：

1. 它使用 https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/[Maven Shade Plugin]创建一个具有所有必需依赖项的单个Jar归档文件，后缀为 `-fat.jar`，也称为“fat Jar”
2. 它使用 http://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/[Exec Maven Plugin] 来提供 `exec:java` 目标，依次通过Vert.x的 `io.vertx.core.Launcher`类启动应用程序。 这实际上相当于使用Vert.x发行版中的 `vertx`命令行工具来运行。

最后，您会注意到 `redeploy.sh` 和 `redeploy.bat` 脚本的存在，您可以使用它们在代码更改时自动编译和重新部署。 请注意，这样做需要确保这些脚本中的 `VERTICLE` 变量与要使用的主Verticle相匹配。

[NOTE]
====
或者，Fabric8项目托管一个 https://vmp.fabric8.io/[a Vert.x Maven plugin]。 它的目标是初始化，构建，打包和运行Vert.x项目。Alternatively, the Fabric8 project hosts https://vmp.fabric8.io/[a Vert.x Maven plugin].
It has goals to initialize, build, package and run a Vert.x project.

通过克隆Git启动器存储库来生成一个类似的项目：

    mkdir vertx-wiki
    cd vertx-wiki
    mvn io.fabric8:vertx-maven-plugin:1.0.7:setup -DvertxVersion=3.5.0
    git init

== 添加所需的依赖关系Adding the required dependencies

要添加到Maven `pom.xml` 文件的第一批依赖关系是用于Web处理和呈现的：The first batch of dependencies to add to the Maven `pom.xml` file are those for the web processing and rendering:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=web-deps]
----

TIP: As the `vertx-web-templ-freemarker` name suggests, Vert.x web provides pluggable support for popular template engines: Handlebars, Jade, MVEL, Pebble, Thymeleaf and of course Freemarker.

The second set of dependencies are those required for JDBC database access:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=db-deps]
----

The Vert.x JDBC client library provides access to any JDBC-compliant database, but of course our project needs to have a JDBC driver on the _classpath_.

http://hsqldb.org/[HSQLDB] is well-known relational database that is written in Java.
It is quite popular when used as an embedded database to avoid the requirement of having a third-party database server running separately.
It is also popular for unit and integration testing as it offers a (volatile) in-memory storage.

HSQLDB as an embedded database is a good fit to get us started.
It stores data in local files, and since the HSQLDB library Jar provides a JDBC driver the Vert.x JDBC configuration will be straightforward.

[NOTE]
====
Vert.x also offers dedicated http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-mysql-postgresql-client/java/[MySQL and PostgreSQL client] libraries.

Of course you can use the general-purpose Vert.x JDBC client to connect to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases, but these libraries offers better performance by working with these 2 database server network protocols rather than going through the (blocking) JDBC APIs.
====

NOTE: Vert.x also provides libraries to deal with the popular non-relational databases http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-mongo-client/java/[MongoDB] and http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-redis-client/java/[Redis].
The larger community offers integration with other storage systems like Apache Cassandra, OrientDB or ElasticSearch.

== Anatomy of a verticle

The verticle for our wiki consists of a single `io.vertx.guides.wiki.MainVerticle` Java class.
This class extends `io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle`, the base class for verticles that mainly provides:

1. life-cycle `start` and `stop` methods to override,
2. a _protected_ field called `vertx` that references the Vert.x environment where the verticle is being deployed,
3. an accessor to some configuration object that allows passing external configuration to a verticle.

To get started our verticle can just override the `start` method as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class MainVerticle extends AbstractVerticle {

  @Override
  public void start(Future<Void> startFuture) throws Exception {
    startFuture.complete();
  }
}
----

There are 2 forms of `start` (and `stop`) methods: 1 with no argument and 1 with a _future_ object reference.
The no-argument variants imply that the verticle initialization or house-keeping phases always succeed unless an exception is being thrown.
The variants with a _future_ object provide a more fine-grained approach to _eventually_ signal that operations succeeded or not.
Indeed, some initialization or cleanup code may require asynchronous operations, so reporting via a _future_ object naturally fits with asynchronous idioms.

== A word on Vert.x future objects and callbacks

Vert.x futures are not JDK futures: they can be composed and queried in a non-blocking fashion.
They shall be used for simple coordination of asynchronous tasks, and especially those of deploying verticles and checking if they were successfully deployed or not.

The Vert.x core APIs are based on callbacks to notify of asynchronous events.
The seasoned developer will naturally think that this opens the door to the so-called _"callback hell"_ where multiple levels of nested callbacks render the code difficult to comprehend as illustrated by this fictional code:

[source,java]
----
foo.a(1, res1 -> {
  if (res1.succeeded()) {
    bar.b("abc", 1, res2 -> {
      if (res.succeeded()) {
         baz.c(res3 -> {
           dosomething(res1, res2, res3, res4 -> {
               // (...)
           });
         });
      }
    });
  }
});
----

While the core APIs could have been designed to favor promises and futures, the choice of callbacks is actually interesting since it allows different programming abstractions to be used.
Vert.x is a largely un-opinionated project, and callbacks allow the implementation of different models that better cope with asynchronous programming: reactive extensions (via RxJava), promises and futures, fibers (using bytecode instrumentation), etc.

Since all Vert.x APIs are callback-oriented before other abstractions like RxJava can be leveraged, this guide only uses callbacks in the first sections to ensure that the reader gets familiar with the core concepts in Vert.x.
It is also arguably easier to start with callbacks to draw a line between the many sections of asynchronous code.
Once it becomes evident in the sample code that callbacks do not always lead to easily readable code, we will introduce the RxJava support to show how the same asynchronous code can be better expressed by thinking in streams of processed events.

== Wiki verticle initialization phases

To get our wiki running, we need to perform a 2-phases initialization:

1. we need to establish a JDBC database connection, and also make sure that the database schema is in place, and
2. we need to start a HTTP server for the web application.

Each phase can fail (e.g., the HTTP server TCP port is already being used), and they should not run in parallel as the web application code first needs the database access to work.

To make our code _cleaner_ we will define 1 method per phase, and adopt a pattern of returning a _future / promise_ object to notify when each of the phases completes, and whether it did so successfully or not:

[source,java]
----
private Future<Void> prepareDatabase() {
  Future<Void> future = Future.future();
  // (...)
  return future;
}

private Future<Void> startHttpServer() {
  Future<Void> future = Future.future();
  // (...)
  return future;
}
----

By having each method returning a _future_ object, the implementation of the `start` method becomes a composition:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=start]
----

When the _future_ of `prepareDatabase` completes successfully, then `startHttpServer` is called and the `steps` future completes depending of the outcome of the future returned by `startHttpServer`.
`startHttpServer` is never called if `prepareDatabase` encounters an error, in which case the `steps` _future_ is in a _failed_ state and becomes completed with the exception describing the error.

Eventually `steps` completes: `setHandler` defines a handler to be called upon completion.
In our case we simply want to complete `startFuture` with `steps` and use the `completer` method to obtain a handler.
This is equivalent to:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=another-start]
----
<1> `ar` is of type `AsyncResult<Void>`.
`AsyncResult<T>` is used to pass the result of an asynchronous processing and may either yield a value of type `T` on success or a failure exception is the processing failed.

=== Database initialization

The wiki database schema consists of a single table `Pages` with the following columns:

[options="header"]
|===
|Column |Type |Description

|`Id`
|Integer
|Primary key

|`Name`
|Characters
|Name of a wiki page, must be unique

|`Content`
|Text
|Markdown text of a wiki page
|===

The database operations will be typical _create, read, update, delete_ operations.
To get us started, we simply store the corresponding SQL queries as static fields of the `MainVerticle` class.
Note that they are written in a SQL dialect that HSQLDB understands, but that other relational databases may not necessarily support:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=sql-fields]
----
<1> The `?` in the queries are placeholders to pass data when executing queries, and the Vert.x JDBC client prevents from SQL injections.

The application verticle needs to keep a reference to a `JDBCClient` object (from the `io.vertx.ext.jdbc` package) that serves as the connection to the database.
We do so using a field in `MainVerticle`, and we also create a general-purpose logger from the `org.slf4j` package:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=db-and-logger]
----

Last but not least, here is the complete implementation of the `prepareDatabase` method.
It attempts to obtain a JDBC client connection, then performs a SQL query to create the `Pages` table unless it already exists:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=prepareDatabase]
----
<1> `createShared` creates a shared connection to be shared among verticles known to the `vertx` instance, which in general is a good thing.
<2> The JDBC client connection is made by passing a Vert.x JSON object. Here `url` is the JDBC URL.
<3> Just like `url`, `driver_class` is specific to the JDBC driver being used and points to the driver class.
<4> `max_pool_size` is the number of concurrent connections. We chose 30 here, but it is just an arbitrary number.
<5> Getting a connection is an asynchronous operation that gives us an `AsyncResult<SQLConnection>`. It must then be tested to see if the connection could be established or not (`AsyncResult` is actually a super-interface of `Future`).
<6> If the SQL connection could not be obtained, then the method _future_ is completed to fail with the `AsyncResult`-provided exception via the `cause` method.
<7> The `SQLConnection` is the result of the successful `AsyncResult`. We can use it to perform a SQL query.
<8> Before checking whether the SQL query succeeded or not, we must release it by calling `close`, otherwise the JDBC client connection pool can eventually drain.
<9> We complete the method _future_ object with a success.

TIP: The SQL database modules supported by the Vert.x project do not currently offer anything beyond passing SQL queries (e.g., an object-relationnal mapper) as they focus on providing asynchronous access to databases.
However, nothing forbids using https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-awesome[more advanced modules from the community], and we especially recommend checking out projects like https://github.com/jklingsporn/vertx-jooq[this jOOq generator for Vert.x] or https://github.com/BraintagsGmbH/vertx-pojo-mapper[this POJO mapper].

=== Notes about logging

The previous subsection introduced a logger, and we opted for the https://www.slf4j.org/[SFL4J library].
Vert.x is also unopinionated on logging: you can choose any popular Java logging library.
We recommend SLF4J since it is a popular logging abstraction and unification library in the Java ecosystem.

We also recommend using https://logback.qos.ch/[Logback] as a logger implementation.
Integrating both SLF4J and Logback can be done by adding two dependencies, or just `logback-classic` that points to both libraries (incidentally they are from the same author):

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=logger]
----

By default SLF4J outputs many log events to the console from Vert.x, Netty, C3PO and the wiki application.
We can reduce the verbosity by adding the a `src/main/resources/logback.xml` configuration file (see https://logback.qos.ch/ for more details):

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/logback.xml[tags=conf]
----

Last but not least HSQLDB does not integrate well with loggers when embedded.
By default it tries to reconfigure the logging system in place, so we need to disable it by passing a `-Dhsqldb.reconfig_logging=false` property to the Java Virtual Machine when executing applications.

=== HTTP server initialization

The HTTP server makes use of the `vertx-web` project to easily define _dispatching routes_ for incoming HTTP requests.
Indeed, the Vert.x core API allows to start HTTP servers and listen for incoming connections, but it does not provide any facility to, say, have different handlers depending on the requested URL or processing request bodies.
This is the role of a _router_ as it dispatches requests to different processing handlers depending on the URL, the HTTP method, etc.

The initialization consists in setting up a _request router_, then starting the HTTP server:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=startHttpServer]
----
<1> The `vertx` context object provides methods to create HTTP servers, clients, TCP/UDP servers and clients, etc.
<2> The `Router` class comes from `vertx-web`: `io.vertx.ext.web.Router`.
<3> Routes have their own handlers, and they can be defined by URL and/or by HTTP method. For short handlers a Java lambda is an option, but for more elaborated handlers it is a good idea to reference private methods instead. Note that URLs can be parametric: `/wiki/:page` will match a request like `/wiki/Hello`, in which case a `page` parameter will be available with value `Hello`.
<4> This makes all HTTP POST requests got through a first handler, here `io.vertx.ext.web.handler.BodyHandler`. This handler automatically decodes the body from the HTTP requests (e.g., form submissions), which can then be manipulated as Vert.x buffer objects.
<5> The router object can be used as a HTTP server handler, which then dispatches to other handlers as defined above.
<6> Starting a HTTP server is an asynchronous operation, so an `AsyncResult<HttpServer>` needs to be checked for success. By the way the `8080` parameter specifies the TCP port to be used by the server.

== HTTP router handlers

The HTTP router instance of the `startHttpServer` method points to different handlers based on URL patterns and HTTP methods.
Each handlers deals with a HTTP request, performs a database query, and renders HTML from a FreeMarker template.

=== Index page handler

The index page provides a list of pointers to all wiki entries and a field to create a new one:

image::images/index.png[Wiki index]

The implementation is a straightforward `select *` SQL query where data is then passed to the FreeMarker engine to render the HTML response.

The `indexHandler` method code is as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=indexHandler]
----
<1> SQL query results are being returned as instances of `JsonArray` and `JsonObject`.
<2> The `RoutingContext` instance can be used to put arbitrary key / value data that is then available from templates, or chained router handlers.
<3> Rendering a template is an asynchronous operation that leads us to the usual `AsyncResult` handling pattern.
<4> The `AsyncResult` contains the template rendering as a `String` in case of success, and we can end the HTTP response stream with the value.
<5> In case of failure the `fail` method from `RoutingContext` provides a sensible way to return a HTTP 500 error to the HTTP client.

FreeMarker templates shall be placed in the `src/main/resources/templates` folder.
The `index.ftl` template code is as follows:

[source,html]
----
include::src/main/resources/templates/index.ftl[]
----

Key / value data stored in the `RoutingContext` object is made available through the `context` FreeMarker variable.

Since lots of templates have common header and footers, we extracted the following code in `header.ftl` and `footer.ftl`:

.`header.ftl`
[source,html]
----
include::src/main/resources/templates/header.ftl[]
----

.`footer.ftl`
[source,html]
----
include::src/main/resources/templates/footer.ftl[]
----

=== Wiki page rendering handler

This handler deals with HTTP GET requests to have wiki pages being rendered, as in:

image::images/page.png[Wiki page]

The page also provides a button to edit the content in Markdown.
Instead of having a separate handler and template, we simply rely on JavaScript and CSS to toggle the editor on and off when the button is being clicked:

image::images/edit.png[Wiki editor]

The `pageRenderingHandler` method code is the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=pageRenderingHandler]
----
<1> URL parameters (`/wiki/:name` here) can be accessed through the context request object.
<2> Passing argument values to SQL queries is done using a `JsonArray`, with the elements in order of the `?` symbols in the SQL query.
<3> The `Processor` class comes from the _txtmark_ Markdown rendering library that we use.

The `page.ftl` FreeMarker template code is as follows:

[source,html]
----
include::src/main/resources/templates/page.ftl[]
----

=== Page creation handler

The index page offers a field to create a new page, and its surrounding HTML form points to a URL that is being managed by this handler.
The strategy isn't actually to create a new entry in the database, but simply to redirect to a wiki page URL with the name to create.
Since the wiki page doesn't exist, the `pageRenderingHandler` method will use a default text for new pages, and a user can eventually create that page by editing then saving it.

The handler is the `pageCreateHandler` method, and its implementation is a redirection through a HTTP 303 status code:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=pageCreateHandler]
----

=== Page saving handler

The `pageUpdateHandler` method deals with HTTP POST requests when saving a wiki page.
This happens both when updating an existing page (issuing a SQL `update` query) or saving a new page (issuing a SQL `insert` query):

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=pageUpdateHandler]
----
<1> Form parameters sent through a HTTP POST request are available from the `RoutingContext` object. Note that without a `BodyHandler` within the `Router` configuration chain these values would not be available, and the form submission payload would need to be manually decoded from the HTTP POST request payload.
<2> We rely on a form hidden field rendered in the `page.ftl` FreeMarker template to know if we are updating an existing page or saving a new page.
<3> Again, preparing the SQL query with parameters uses a `JsonArray` to pass values.
<4> The `updateWithParams` method is used for `insert` / `update` / `delete` SQL queries.
<5> Upon success, we simply redirect to the page that has been edited.

=== Page deletion handler

The implementation of the `pageDeletionHandler` method is straightforward: given a wiki entry identifier, it issues a `delete` SQL query then redirects to the wiki index page:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/MainVerticle.java[tags=pageDeletionHandler]
----

== Running the application

At this stage we have a working, self-contained wiki application.

To run it we first need to build it with Maven:

    $ mvn clean package

Since the build produces a Jar will all required dependencies embedded (including Vert.x and a JDBC database), running the wiki is as simple as:

    $ java -jar target/wiki-step-1-1.1.0-fat.jar

You can then point your favorite web browser to http://localhost:8080/ and enjoy using the wiki.
