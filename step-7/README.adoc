= 安全和控制访问

TIP: 	相应的源代码位于指南存储库的 `step-7` 文件夹中。

安全和控制访问对于Vert.x来说很容易。 在本节中，我们将：

1. 从HTTP转移到HTTPS，
2. 使用基于组的权限将用户身份验证添加到Web应用程序，
3. 使用 https://jwt.io/[_JSON web 令牌_ (JWT)]  对Web API进行控制访问。

== HTTPS support in Vert.x

Vert.x provides support for SSL-encrypted network connections.
It is common to expose HTTP servers in production through a front HTTP server / proxy like Nginx, and have it use HTTPS for incoming connections.
Vert.x can also expose HTTPS by itself, so as to provide end-to-end encryption.

Certificates can be stored in Java _KeyStore_ files.
You will likely need a _self-signed certificate_ for testing purposes, and here is how to create one in a `server-keystore.jks` KeyStore where the password is `secret`:

[source,text,indent=0]
----
include::gen-keystore.sh[tags=https-keygen]
----

We can then change the HTTP server creation to pass a `HttpServerOptions` object to specify that we want SSL, and to point to our KeyStore file:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=https-server]
----

We can point a web browser to https://localhost:8080/, but since the certificate is a self-signed one any good browser will rightfully yield a security warning:

image::images/invalid-cert.png[]

Last but not least, we need to update the test case in `ApiTest` since the original code was made for issuing HTTP requests with the web client:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/ApiTest.java[tags=test-https]
----
<1> Ensures SSL.
<2> Since the certificate is self-signed, we need to explicitly trust it otherwise the web client connections will fail just like a web browser would.

== Access control and authentication

Vert.x provides a wide range of options for doing authentication and authorization.
The officially supported modules cover JDBC, MongoDB, https://shiro.apache.org/[Apache Shiro], OAuth2 with well-known providers and JWT (JSON web tokens).

While the next section will cover JWT, this one focuses on using Apache Shiro which is especially interesting when authentication must be backed by a LDAP or Active Directory server.
In our case we will simply store the credentials in a properties file to keep things simple, but the API usage against a LDAP server remains the same.

The goal is to require users to authenticate for using the wiki, and have role-based permissions:

* having no role only allows reading pages,
* having a _writer_ role allows editing pages,
* having an _editor_ role allows creating, editing and deleting pages,
* having an _admin_ role is equivalent to having all possible roles.

WARNING: The Vert.x Shiro integration has some issues due to the inner workings of Apache Shiro. Some parts are blocking which can hinder performance, and some data is stored using thread local state. You should not try abusing the exposed internal state APIs either.

=== Adding Apache Shiro authentication to routes

The first step is to add the `vertx-auth-shiro` module to the Maven dependencies list:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=shiro]
----

The properties file definition that we use is the following, located in `src/main/resources/wiki-users.properties`:

[source,index=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/wiki-users.properties[tags=props]
----

A `user`-prefixed entry is a user account, where the first value entry is the password possibly followed by roles.
In this example user `bar` has password `baz`, is a `writer`, and a `writer` has `update` permission.

Back to the `HttpServerVerticle` class code, we create an authentication provider using Apache Shiro:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=shiro-auth]
----

The `ShiroAuth` object instance is then used to deal with server-side user sessions:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=shiro-routes]
----
<1> We install a user session handler for all routes.
<2> This automatically redirects requests to `/login` when there is no user session for the request.
<3> We install `authHandler` for all routes where authentication is required.

Finally, we need to create 3 routes for displaying a login form, handling login form submissions and logging out users:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=shiro-login]
----
<1> `FormLoginHandler` is a helper for processing login submission requests. By default it expects the HTTP POST request to have: `username` as the login, `password` as the password, and `return_url` as the URL to redirect to upon success.
<2> Logging out a user is a simple as clearing it from the current `RoutingContext`.

The code for the `loginHandler` method is:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=loginHandler]
----

The HTML template is placed in `src/main/resources/templates/login.ftl`:

[source,html]
----
include::src/main/resources/templates/login.ftl[]
----

The login page looks as follows:

image::images/login-form.png[]

=== Supporting features based on roles

Features need to be activated only if the user has sufficient permissions.
In the following screenshot an administrator can create a page and perform a backup:

image::images/as-root.png[]

By contrast a user with no role cannot perform these actions:

image::images/as-baz.png[]

To do that, we can access the `RoutingContext` user reference, and query for permissions.
Here is how this is implemented for the `indexHandler` handler method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=indexHandler]
----
<1> This is how a permission query is made. Note that this is an asynchronous operation.
<2> We use the result to...
<3> ...leverage it in the HTML template.
<4> We also have access to the user login.

The template code has been modified to only render certain fragments based on the value of `canCreatePage`:

[source,html]
----
include::src/main/resources/templates/index.ftl[]
----

The code is similar for ensuring that updating or deleting a page is restricted to certain roles and is available from the guide Git repository.

It is important to ensure that checks are also being done on HTTP POST request handlers and not just when rendering HTML pages.
Indeed, malicious attackers could still craft requests and perform actions while not being authenticated.
Here is how to protect page deletions by wrapping the `pageDeletionHandler` code inside a topmost permission check:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=pageDeletionHandler]
----

== Authenticating web API requests with JWT

https://jwt.io/[JSON Web Tokens] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[RFC 7519]) is a standard for issuing JSON-encoded tokens containing _claims_, typically identifying a user and permissions, although claims can be just about anything.

A token is issued by a server and it is signed with the server key.
A client can send a token back along with subsequent requests: both the client and the server can check that a token is authentic and unaltered.

WARNING: While a JWT token is signed, its content is not encrypted. It must be transported over a secure channel (e.g., HTTPS) and it should never have sensitive data as a claim (e.g., passwords, private API keys, etc).

=== Adding JWT support

We start by adding the `vertx-auth-jwt` module to the Maven dependencies:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=jwt]
----

We will have a JCEKS keystore to hold the keys for our tests.
Here is how to generate a `keystore.jceks` with the suitable keys of various lengths:

[source,text,indent=0]
----
include::gen-keystore.sh[tags=jwt-keygen]
----

We need to install a JWT token handler on API routes:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=jwtAuth]
----

We pass `/api/token` as a parameter for the `JWTAuthHandler` object creation to specify that this URL shall be ignored.
Indeed, this URL is being used to generate new JWT tokens:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=issue-jwt]
----
<1> We expect login and password information to have been passed through HTTP request headers, and we authenticate using the Apache Shiro authentication provider of the previous section.
<2> Upon success we can query for roles.
<3> We generate a token with `username`, `canCreate`, `canDelete` and `canUpdate` claims.

Each API handler method can now query the current user principal and claims.
Here is how the `apiDeletePage` does it:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=apiDeletePage]
----

=== Using JWT tokens

To illustrate how to work with JWT tokens, let's create a new one for the `root` user:

----
$ http --verbose --verify no GET https://localhost:8080/api/token login:root password:w00t
GET /api/token HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.9.8
login: root
password: w00t



HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 242
Content-Type: text/plain
Set-Cookie: vertx-web.session=8cbb38ac4ce96737bfe31cc0ceaae2b9; Path=/

eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InJvb3QiLCJjYW5DcmVhdGUiOnRydWUsImNhbkRlbGV0ZSI6dHJ1ZSwiY2FuVXBkYXRlIjp0cnVlLCJpYXQiOjE0ODk0NDE1OTAsImlzcyI6IlZlcnQueCIsInN1YiI6Ildpa2kgQVBJIn0=.RmtJb81QKVUFreXL-ajZ8ktLGasoKEqG8GSQncRWrN8=
----

The response text is the token value and shall be retained.

We can check that performing an API request without the token results in a denial of access:

----
$ http --verbose --verify no GET https://localhost:8080/api/pages
GET /api/pages HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.9.8



HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Length: 12

Unauthorized
----

Sending a JWT token along with a request is done using a `Authorization` HTTP request header where the value must be `Bearer <token value>`.
Here is how to fix the API request above by passing the JWT token that had been issued to us:

----
$ http --verbose --verify no GET https://localhost:8080/api/pages 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InJvb3QiLCJjYW5DcmVhdGUiOnRydWUsImNhbkRlbGV0ZSI6dHJ1ZSwiY2FuVXBkYXRlIjp0cnVlLCJpYXQiOjE0ODk0NDE1OTAsImlzcyI6IlZlcnQueCIsInN1YiI6Ildpa2kgQVBJIn0=.RmtJb81QKVUFreXL-ajZ8ktLGasoKEqG8GSQncRWrN8='

User-Agent: HTTPie/0.9.8



HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 99
Content-Type: application/json
Set-Cookie: vertx-web.session=0598697483371c7f3cb434fbe35f15e4; Path=/

{
    "pages": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "name": "Hello"
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Apple"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Vert.x"
        }
    ],
    "success": true
}
----

=== Adapting the API test fixture

The `ApiTest` class needs to be updated to support JWT tokens.

We add a new field for retrieving the token value to be used in test cases:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/ApiTest.java[tags=tokenField]
----

We add first step to retrieve a JTW token authenticated as user `foo`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/ApiTest.java[tags=fetch-token]
----
<1> Credentials are passed as headers.
<2> The response payload is of `text/plain` type, so we use that for the body decoding codec.
<3> Upon success we complete the `tokenRequest` future with the token value.

Using the JWT token is now a matter of passing it back as a header to HTTP requests:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/ApiTest.java[tags=use-token]
----
<1> We store the token with the `Bearer` prefix to the field for the next requests.
<2> We pass the token as a header.
